SimpleCalculator
================

I made a calculator to test my knowledge in java, it has four options, add, subtract, multiply and divide.
It has one class, and it's based on beginner knowledge, so there might be dead code.

class bye {

public static void main (String[] args){

System.out.println("Thank you for visiting");

  }

}
